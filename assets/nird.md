# How This Site Is Hosted

If we encourage you to save the planet by giving your old tech devices a second life, it only makes sense that we do the same ourselves.

This website is proudly hosted on an old computer, rescued from obsolescence and brought back to life thanks to **NIRD OS**. Instead of ending up as electronic waste, this machine now powers a living, breathing platform on the internet.

By choosing this setup, we reduce hardware waste, lower energy consumption, and prove that powerful solutions don’t always require brand-new machines. It’s our way of showing that sustainability isn’t just a message — it’s a practice.

Every page you load is a small reminder that reuse, creativity, and responsibility can truly shape a better digital future.
